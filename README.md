# Recommender-System
A recommendation system for electronic products

This Jupyter Notebook explores and implements two different approaches to building a recommendation system for electronic products:

1. Popularity-Based Recommendation:

This approach recommends products based on their overall popularity among all users.
It identifies the most frequently purchased or highly-rated products and suggests them to everyone, regardless of individual user preferences.
It's a simple and straightforward method, but it lacks personalization.

2. Collaborative Filtering:

This approach recommends products based on the preferences of similar users.
It leverages the idea that if two users have liked similar items in the past, they are likely to have similar tastes in the future.
The notebook uses a technique called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify latent relationships between users and products within a user-item rating matrix.
This method offers more personalized recommendations compared to the popularity-based approach.
Data and Preprocessing:

The notebook uses a dataset of electronic product ratings.
It performs data cleaning, such as handling missing values and selecting a subset of the data to reduce sparsity and improve performance.
It creates a user-item rating matrix, which is a core data structure for recommendation systems.
Evaluation:

The notebook evaluates the collaborative filtering model using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
RMSE measures the difference between predicted ratings and actual ratings, providing an indication of the model's accuracy.
Recommendation Generation:

The notebook provides functions to generate top-K recommendations for a given user, where K is the desired number of recommendations.
It demonstrates how to retrieve recommendations for specific users using both the popularity-based and collaborative filtering models.
Overall:

This notebook provides a practical demonstration of building and evaluating recommendation systems using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. It showcases two common recommendation approaches and highlights their strengths and limitations. By understanding the concepts and techniques presented in this notebook, one can gain valuable insights into the field of recommender systems and apply them to various domains.
